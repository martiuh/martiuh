# My name is Tona and I welcome you to my `REAMDE.md`

I'm a developer who works mostly with Javascript (React, Express.js) and I have a lot of fun building stuff and having a lot of ideas, although sometimes I don't manage my time propertly to build and do more, probably because I'm playing videogames or watching a cool anime.

### A cool project
The first (and by now only) open source project I build was **[chido](https://github.com/martiuh/chido)** which is archived right now because the feature I was trying to build (a hybrid site generator with React) was available (in a way) with react-static. So I decided to archive my project and work with react-static instead. I learned A LOT building **chido**. 

### Where I work
Right now I'm working @ [Nearsoft](https://nearsoftjobs.com/jobs/)
